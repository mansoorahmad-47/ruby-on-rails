# Ruby on Rails

## p, puts, print, variables, and reverse
```bash
address = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

```bash
p address 
```
This prints the address array
```bash
new_address = address.reverse! 
```
The reverse! method will reverse data and destroy the original address with the new reversed one
```bash
p new_address  
```
Print in new line, and `show quotes` signs of string
```bash
new_address2 = address.reverse
```
Meanwhile the reverse only reverse the address and save it in new_address2 but the original address remains the same as before 
```bash
print new_address2
```
No quote signs, Print everything in only one line without giving a newline
```bash
puts new_address2
```
Print each item of array in `newline` and in `1 line` when a single string. It shows quotes
```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash

```
```bash
